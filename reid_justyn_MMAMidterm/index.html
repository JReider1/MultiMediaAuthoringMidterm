        <h2>The halo was a necessary innovation</h2>

        <p>It is no secret that the halo has been one of the biggest innovations in recent times in the world of Formula 1. Invented in response to a growing safety concern about open cockpits in open wheel race cars, the halo is a device that helps to deflect and protect the driver from hazards, such as other cars and other large debris. The main concern with the halo is that it impairs driver visibility, which is entirely untrue. The bar in the driver’s view has been proven to not impair any vision while driving, and many drivers have stated they barely notice its presence while driving.   </p>

        <p>Although there are other possibilities, such as the windscreen used in series like IndyCar, the sturdiness the halo offers is unmatched by the windscreen, and many crashes where the halo saved the life of the driver could have ended much differently if the plexiglass windscreen was used, such as the crash of Zhou Guanyu at the 2022 British Grand Prix, pictured above. The halo has already saved countless lives in many massive accidents, and has received universal praise from drivers, teams and fans alike. Its impact on not just Formula 1, but the entire world of motorsport in unquestionable, and to suggest that it should be removed is ridiculous. </p>

        <h2>Why the F1 Halo is Stupid</h2>

        <p>The halo is easily the worst thing to be introduced into formula one. It is supposed to be a safety feature but in reality it is less safe than before.
        The halo sits right in the middle of the driver's view… which is ridiculous why I should have to explain why that's not safe. The halo has now created a blind 
        spot for drivers who now may not even see obstacles that litter the track. Don't believe me? Ask the drivers! Every driver that has driven with the halo has expressed their hatred for it. </p>

        <p>The next stupid thing about the halo is obviously how ugly it looks. Formula one is a glamorous sport, or it used to be before the big ugly halo. It is the main factor old die hard fans are 
        leaving the sport and ditching their merchandise. F1 has to lose the halo or it will lose all of its fans.</p>
